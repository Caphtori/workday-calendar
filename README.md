# workday-scheduler

## Description

A workday scheduling application that allows you to create and save tasks on the browser's local data, check them off, and delete them.  Past, present, and future times are distinct, as are the weekends.  When an hour that contains tasks is over, the application distinguishes with font colors between those that were completed and those that weren't.  The application allows you to change days.
